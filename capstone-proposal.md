Name of Student: Joseph Jackson

Name of Project: Fantasy Football Stat tracker

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
Enable user to view current and past data for players in the NFL in order to make better judgement of future performance

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
View player data for the current season
Be able to search specific players
sort players by stats
pick a handful of players to watch and see their trends

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
Either an API or possibly R libraries. The R libraries are readily available, however I will need to learn R. Yahoo is not currently letting me get an API key but I think I found a cheaper alternative. I also found a resource scraper to get player data from other public websites.

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
compare players
get player news
point out trends

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
maybe R

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
